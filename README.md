# Description
Keahua Arboretum is an app made for the terminal to keep track of how many animals and plants are kept in certain environments. It also helps keep
track of when you last fed the animals, allows you to add plants or animals to their specific environments, and lets you add more environments to your arboretum. You can get an overall look at each environment and see which animals and plants it contains.
